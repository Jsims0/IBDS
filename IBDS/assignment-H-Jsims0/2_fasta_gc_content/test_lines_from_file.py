"""
pytest test for function lines_from_file using files in this directory.

Note this is not really a UNIT test as it reads actual files, it
is more of an integration test.
A unit test tests the functioning of the module in isolation from
other modules, particularly if they involve inteaction with external
resources such as disk files, database access or web access. This
is normally done by mocking.
